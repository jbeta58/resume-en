    - name: Financial Analysis

            The last 5 years I have contributed to decision-making in business management, through
            the development of several financial artefacts and KPIs, with data obtained from different

            Power BI, among others.

            For 2 years, and the total execution of the contract, I managed an important construction project
            in Montería CO, where I generated synergies among all the stakeholders (aqueduct company,

            seeks the elimination of losses in projects processes (Planning, Execution, Delivery and After Sales),
